## Overview

| Stage | Deliverable | Tooling |
|---|---|---|
| **Data cleaning** | Raw Kaggle export (2000 × 8) → cleaned dataset (2000 × 12) + quality report | Python, pandas, NumPy |
| **Quality assurance** | 12 automated data-quality checks, all passing | pytest |
| **Exploratory analysis** | Executed, error-free EDA notebook | Jupyter |
| **Visualization** | Interactive BI-style dashboard, zero runtime dependencies | HTML / CSS / vanilla JS |
| **Delivery** | Automatic deploy of `dashboard/` on every push to `main` | GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages |

## The Pipeline

```
raw CSV ──► clean_forbes_2000.py ──► cleaned CSV + quality report
                                          │
                              pytest (12 checks) ✅
                                          │
                          embedded as JSON in dashboard/script.js
                                          │
                     push to main ──► GitHub Actions ──► GitHub Pages
```

### Cleaning highlights

- Split `Headquarters` → `City` + `Country` (62 countries) — including an edge case where one company listed only a country, caught by the test suite and fixed at the source
- Filled 1 missing `Industry` using business-profile judgment; left 1 missing `Market Value` as an honest null rather than fabricating a number
- Engineered `Profit_Margin_%`, `Asset_Efficiency`, and `ROA_%` from source columns only

### Test suite

12 automated checks covering row counts, schema, duplicates, value ranges, null bounds, junk-string detection, and a numerical spot-check that recomputes Profit Margin from source columns. **12/12 passing.**

## The Dashboard

BI-tool layout in a single deployable folder — sidebar navigation, KPI row, sticky filters panel, linked chart grid, computed insights, and a sortable company explorer.

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Live filters** | Country · Industry · Rank Range · Profitability tier · name search — every chart, KPI, insight, and table updates together |
| **Charts** | Market value by rank tier, industry donut, country heat-grid, top-10 leaderboard, industry bars, margin histogram, ROA by tier |
| **Insights engine** | Concentration, geographic exposure, and margin-split narratives recomputed from whatever subset is filtered — with threshold-based recommendations |
| **Design** | "Trading Floor" palette — near-black, gold accent, green/red ticker coding on profitability figures |
| **Zero runtime dependencies** | Dataset embedded as inline JSON — no fetch, no CORS issues, works opened directly from disk |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Re-run the cleaning pipeline (optional — outputs are committed)
cd scripts && python3 clean_forbes_2000.py

# 3. Run the data quality tests
pytest tests/test_data_quality.py -v

# 4. Open the dashboard — no server needed
open dashboard/index.html        # macOS
start dashboard\index.html       # Windows
```

**Deployment** is fully automated: any push to `main` that touches `dashboard/` triggers the GitHub Actions workflow, which publishes the folder to GitHub Pages.

## Key Findings

- **US dominance:** 595 of 2,000 companies (29.8%); US + China + Japan account for over half the list
- **Banking everywhere:** largest industry by count (314 companies, 15.7%)
- **Top-heavy value:** NVIDIA ($5.48T), Alphabet ($4.81T), and Apple ($4.41T) lead a top-10 that holds a disproportionate share of total market value
- **Profitability varies structurally:** avg margin 20.7% and avg ROA 5.9% mask wide sector differences — asset-heavy sectors (banking, insurance) post low ROA by design
